## 🧠 AI Integration

Scoutiva's AI engine provides:

- 👣 Real-time crowd density prediction  
- 🎯 Personalized suggestions and navigation  
- 🚨 Anomaly detection and safety alerts

### ✅ Live AI Integration with UI

We’ve connected our **CrowdSense AI model** with the wearable app interface using the `ai-bridge.js` module located in the `app/` directory.  
When congestion is detected, the AI system triggers:

- 🔔 Band vibrations  
- 💡 Screen flashes  
- ⚠️ Visual alerts for users

> This functional prototype shows how AI enhances safety and responsiveness. Upon winning the competition, we aim to fully implement this system in real stadium environments.
