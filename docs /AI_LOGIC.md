## 🔍 Core AI Features

| Feature                        | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧭 Smart Navigation            | Predicts optimal paths in real-time based on crowd density and user location. |
| 👥 Crowd Density Prediction    | Uses camera input + movement data to estimate congestion in different areas. |
| 🚨 Anomaly Detection           | Identifies abnormal crowd behavior or sudden density spikes.                 |
| 🎯 Personalized Suggestions    | Recommends food stalls, restrooms, exits based on proximity & preferences.  |
| 📢 Emergency Alert System      | Instantly notifies users about incidents and safe evacuation routes.         |

## ⚙️ AI Models Used

- **CrowdSense AI**  
  A lightweight ML model that:
  - Processes data from wearable sensors and external APIs
  - Calculates crowd density using a combination of spatial mapping and time-series forecasting
  - Alerts users when crowd thresholds exceed safe limits

- **RouteOptimizer AI**  
  - Provides optimal route recommendations based on real-time foot traffic
  - Adjusts dynamically as conditions change

- **AnomalyDetector**  
  - Detects unusual patterns or unsafe behaviors using past event data

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Input Collection**  
   - GPS, accelerometer, and AR camera capture real-time environment data.
   - External APIs (e.g., Google Maps) supplement location data.

2. **Processing & Prediction**  
   - AI models process the data on-device or via edge/cloud computing.
   - Models predict crowd density and suggest safe, optimal routes.

3. **Feedback & Interaction**  
   - Band vibrates or flashes for alerts.
   - AR overlay updates based on AI suggestions.
   - UI provides real-time navigation and recommendations.

## 🔐 Data & Privacy

- All user data is anonymized.
- Location data is processed locally or over secure cloud endpoints.
- We follow FIFA cybersecurity standards and GDPR compliance.

---

## 🧪 Training Data Sources

- Simulated event crowd movement datasets
- Real-time location data (prototype stage)
- Open-source crowd analysis datasets (e.g., UCY, ETH)

## 🔄 Future Improvements

- Integrating edge-AI for faster processing
- Training models with real user interaction data
- Adding predictive models for queue times and service demand
- Enhancing anomaly detection with video+sensor fusion
