🧠 Core AI Components

1. CrowdSense AI – Predicts crowd density and movement patterns.
2. SmartRoute Engine – Provides real-time navigation based on crowd flow and shortest path.
3. Anomaly Detector – Detects abnormal behaviors like panic or stampedes.
4. Personalization Layer – Suggests routes, AR content, and nearby services based on fan profile.

⚙️ How It Works

- Smartband Sensors collect live data (location, motion, temperature, proximity).
- Edge Processor filters and sends this data to the ai-bridge.js module.
- CrowdSense AI analyzes crowd density using ML models trained on real match data.
- If a risk is detected:
  - The smartband vibrates and flashes.
  - Navigation is rerouted automatically.
  - Alerts are sent to security and the user.

✅ Example Scenario

Fan is near Gate C and crowd density exceeds safe level.

- CrowdSense AI triggers alert.
- Smartband vibrates + screen flashes warning.
- SmartRoute Engine suggests alternative path to Gate B.
- If panic is detected, Anomaly Detector sends emergency alert to control center.

🧪 Models & Training

- Model Type: LSTM + CNN hybrid
- Training Data: Simulated and historical data from football matches
- Tools: TensorFlow, Python, OpenCV
- Latency: Under 1s on prototype board (ESP32 + edge TPU)

---

📊 Metrics Monitored

- People per square meter (density)
- Rate of crowd movement (flow velocity)
- Detected abnormal acceleration (panic indicator)
- Battery levels and signal strength

---

🔐 Privacy & Security

- All AI processing happens locally or on encrypted channels.
- No facial recognition or personally identifiable information (PII) is stored.
- AI decisions are auditable and explainable.

🚀 Future Enhancements

- Adaptive learning for new stadium layouts
- Personalized fan journeys based on behavior
- Integration with stadium camera feeds (with consent)
