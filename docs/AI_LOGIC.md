# 🧠 AI Logic – Scoutiva Smartband

## 📌 Overview
Scoutiva uses artificial intelligence to enhance the fan experience at stadiums during major sporting events, including the 2034 FIFA World Cup in Saudi Arabia. Our AI model is designed to manage crowd dynamics, personalize recommendations, and ensure safety through real-time data analysis. It operates seamlessly between on-device (edge) and cloud-based intelligence to ensure responsiveness and scalability.

## 📊 Data Sources
The AI system relies on a variety of real-time and historical data sources:
1. **Fan Behavior Data** – movement patterns, interests, purchase history
2. **Stadium Architecture** – entrances, exits, seating plans, facilities
3. **Health Monitoring** – real-time vitals via biometric sensors
4. **AR Analytics** – usage, engagement, and interaction data
5. **AR Content** – cultural and informational overlays
6. **Cultural Design Preferences** – regional styles and expectations
7. **Transport Integration Data** – arrival/departure times, traffic
8. **Solar Energy Metrics** – charging efficiency, usage times
9. **Ticketing & Reservation Data** – seat assignments, fan categories
10. **E-payment Activity** – transaction logs, vendor locations
11. **Emergency & Safety Logs** – crowding incidents, health alerts
12. **User Interaction** – feedback, preferences, navigation behavior

## 🧠 AI Functions

### 1. **Fan Behavior Analysis**
- Recognizes individual and crowd patterns
- Clusters fans based on preferences
- Predicts needs such as food, restroom, or merchandise interest

### 2. **Smart Recommendations**
- Suggests best routes to avoid congestion
- Recommends cultural content or AR experiences
- Pushes timely alerts (e.g., "line at Gate 6 is short")

### 3. **Crowd Management**
- Detects abnormal crowd density
- Recommends redirection routes
- Predicts bottlenecks before they occur

### 4. **Emergency Detection**
- Monitors health sensor data (e.g., heart rate, temperature)
- Notifies medical teams instantly in case of anomalies

### 5. **Contextual Augmented Reality**
- Learns what types of AR content are most engaging
- Dynamically adapts overlays based on time, crowd, or preferences

## ⚙️ AI Logic in Action
- **Sensors** collect live data: GPS, motion, temperature, proximity.
- **Edge Processor** sends pre-processed data to `ai-bridge.js`.
- **CrowdSense AI** predicts crowd levels using LSTM-CNN models.
- When risk is detected:
  - The smartband vibrates and screen flashes.
  - Alternate route is suggested in real-time.
  - Alerts are sent to user and control systems.

### ✅ Example Scenario
**Fan near Gate C, high crowd density detected.**
- CrowdSense AI triggers alert
- Smartband vibrates + flashes warning
- SmartRoute Engine redirects fan to Gate B
- Anomaly Detector monitors panic behavior and notifies control room

## 🧪 AI Models & Tools
- **Model Type**: Hybrid LSTM + CNN architecture
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Python, OpenCV
- **Training Data**: Historical + simulated crowd behavior
- **Deployment Hardware**: ESP32 microcontroller + Edge TPU
